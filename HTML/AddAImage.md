An image is made with an <img> element. It looks like so:

< img src="http://somewebsite.com/image.jpg" alt="short description" >
  
  The source attribute, **src**, is like the href of a link - it is the URL of the image you want to display. For now, your images will need to be hosted online, which means that the URL will need to start with http:// or https://. You'll learn about another way to set image source in the next exercise. The alt attribute stands for **"alternative description,"** which is important for people who use screen readers to browse the web. This is text that will show up in lieu of the actual image.

An image element is a little different than the elements you've seen before. Images do not need closing tags! (For the eager, these are called **"void elements"**.)
