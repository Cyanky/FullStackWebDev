## The HTML Document
  
  Every HTML document you create or load is derived from this basic format:

  
  You can think of it as a template. And, following this template will help ensure that the page is displayed as the developer (you) intended. It not only says what should be displayed, but also includes relevant information that tells the browser how to display it.

  
  This template can be broken down into 3 parts:

  
  DOCTYPE: Describes the type of HTML. While there are technically different types, for 99.999% of the HTML you'll write, youâ€™ll likely be fine with <!DOCTYPE html>.
  
  head: Describes meta information about the site, such as the title, and provides links to scripts and stylesheets the site needs to render and behave correctly.
  
  body: Describes the actual content of the site that users will see.
