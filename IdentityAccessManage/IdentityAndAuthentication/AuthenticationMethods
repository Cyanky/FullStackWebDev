Alternative Authentication Methods
---Single Sign-On (SSO)
Single sign-on is essentially trusting someone else to answer who you are. When users log in to a platform, they can use another platform such as Google, Facebook as a single sign-on provider to authenticate their identities.

---Multi-Factor Authentication
Multi-factor authentication provides us one layer of trust on top of passwords. Essentially, it trusts that you and only you have access to something physical or sensitive and secure.

Once the server validates the initial login request, an additional code is sent to a user's alternative device or service. The user will receive the code and send it back to the server where the code will be checked. Once the code is confirmed valid, the user's login request is allowed.
---Passwordless
Taking multi-factor authentication to an extreme, we have passwordless. To make the authentication passwordless, we remove the password. When a user makes a request, he only has to send the user ID and the server will then send a code to the alternative device. Then the user will use the frontend to send the code back to the server.

---Biometric Authentication
Biometric authentication uses a part of your body to authenticate into a system. The most commonly realized biometric authentication method is fingerprint authentication.
