Curl is a library and command-line tool that completes IP transfers of data using URLs. One quick way to test your API while your API server is running is to run a curl command in another terminal window.

Curl Syntax

curl -X POST http://www.example.com/tasks/

The above is a sample curl request. Every request starts off with the command curl and needs to include a URL. Other parts you see added in are options that you can use to build your request. In the example the -X shortform option (also --request) specifies the request method.

CURL Options
You can find more options by entering the following command in the terminal.

curl --help
Some frequently used options are:

-X or --request COMMAND
-d or --data DATA
-F or --form CONTENT
-u or --user USER[:PASSWORD]
-H or --header LINE
--------------------------------------
 In the question above, did you find it difficult to read the cURL output? Try piping the output to the jq, a command-line JSON processor, as shown below:

curl https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/move/47 | jq '.'
The command above will return a nicely formatted JSON.
