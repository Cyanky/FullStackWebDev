Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is the delivery of IT resources over the Internet. The cloud is like a virtual data center accessible via the Internet that allows you to manage:

Storage services like databases
Servers, compute power, networking
Analytics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality
Security services for data and applications
Characteristics of Cloud Computing
Pay as you go - You pay only for what you use and only when your code runs.
Autoscaling - The number of active servers can grow or shrink based on demand.
Serverless - Allows you to write and deploy code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
Benefits of using Cloud Computing
There are several benefits to the cloud.

Stop guessing about capacity.
Avoid huge capital investments up front.
Pay for only what you use.
Scale globally in minutes.
Deliver faster.
Cloud Deployment Models
Public Cloud: A public cloud makes resources available over the Internet to the general public.

Private Cloud: A private cloud is a proprietary network that supplies services to a limited number of people.

Hybrid Cloud: A hybrid model contains a combination of both a public and a private cloud. The hybrid model is a growing trend in the industry for those organizations that have been slow to adopt the cloud due to being in a heavily regulated industry. The hybrid model gives organizations the flexibility to slowly migrate to the cloud.

Types of Cloud Computing
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): The provider supplies virtual server instances, storage, and mechanisms for you to manage servers.

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): A platform of development tools hosted on a provider's infrastructure.

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): A software application that runs over the Internet and is managed by the service provider.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a Market Leader
There are several popular cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP; however, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the popular public cloud infrastructures. AWS routinely adds new services and invests billions of dollars in the overall platform and infrastructure.
